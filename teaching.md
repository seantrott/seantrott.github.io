### Mentoring

One of my favorite parts of the research community is mentoring students who want to learn more about research. Most recently, I served on the Honors Thesis committee for Alex Liebscher, who investigated whether metaphors we use to describe experiences with cancer affect charitable donations; his honors paper can be found [here](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/honors-program/Liebscher,-Alex_Thesis---Metaphors-on-Charitable-Donations.pdf).  


### Additional information

In Spring 2019, [Pamela Rivi√®re](https://pdrivier.github.io/about/) and I organized a course and speaker series called: **Data Practices (in the 21st century)**. The course featured speakers from a number of departments, including: Anthropology, Computer Science and Engineering, and History. Topics covered included: the ethical and legal balance between transparency and data privacy/security, appropriate and inappropriate statistical practices, the (often exploitative) relationship between scientists and the communities they study, and more. The syllabus can be found [here](https://cogs200sp2019.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/syllabus/).

I'm also passionate about statistics education, and have written a number of [statistics tutorials, mostly in R](https://seantrott.github.io/stats/). For the past two academic years (2019-2020, 2020-present), I've served as the *Statistics in R Methods TA* for the Cognitive Science department.
