I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Computational Social Science (CSS) program](https://css.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego. This means that I split my time teaching classes for CSS and [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/). 

My teaching focuses on **methods** in particular, such as programming (e.g., in Python), data visualization, statistics, and natural language processing. I also teach classes focused on language and cognition.

## Courses I Teach

**CSS 1**: Introductory Programming for Computational Social Science ([website](https://ucsd-css1-introduction.github.io/overview/intro.html))

**CSS 2**: Data and Model Programming for Computational Social Science ([website](https://ucsd-css2.github.io/ucsd-css2-website/intro.html))

**COGS 101C**: Language 

**COGS 14B**: Introduction to Statistical Analysis   

## Methods tutorials

I also create resources for people interested in learning more about statistics and programming in R or Python: see [this page](https://seantrott.github.io/stats/) for more details.

## Mentoring

One of my favorite parts of being in science is mentoring students who want to learn more about research. 

So far, I've been on a couple Honors Thesis committees:

- Alex Liebscher: [do metaphors we use describe experiences with cancer affect charitable donations](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/honors-program/Liebscher,-Alex_Thesis---Metaphors-on-Charitable-Donations.pdf)  
- Monica Van: [do memes scaffold learning mathematical concepts](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/honors-program/Monica-Van_HonorsThesis_-Memes-and-Math-Instruction.pdf)


## Additional information

In Spring 2019, [Pamela Rivi√®re](https://pdrivier.github.io/about/) and I organized a course and speaker series called: **Data Practices (in the 21st century)**. The course featured speakers from a number of departments, including: Anthropology, Computer Science and Engineering, and History. The syllabus can be found [here](https://cogs200sp2019.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/syllabus/).
