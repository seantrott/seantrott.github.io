### Additional information

In Spring 2019 , [Pamela Rivi√®re](https://pdrivier.github.io/about/) and I organized a course and speaker series called: **Data Practices (in the 21st century)**. The course featured speakers from a number of departments, including: Anthropology, Computer Science and Engineering, and History. Topics covered included: the ethical and legal balance between transparency and data privacy/security, appropriate and inappropriate statistical practices, the (often exploitative) relationship between scientists and the communities they study, and more. The syllabus can be found [here](https://cogs200sp2019.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/syllabus/).

I'm also passionate about statistics education, and have written a number of [statistics tutorials, mostly in R](https://seantrott.github.io/stats/).
