I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Cognitive Science department](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) and [Computational Social Science (CSS) program](https://css.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego. This means that I split my time teaching classes for both departments.

My teaching focuses on **methods** in particular, such as programming (e.g., in Python), data visualization, statistics, and natural language processing. I also teach classes focused on language and cognition.

## Courses I Teach

**CSS 1**: Introductory Programming for Computational Social Science ([website](https://ucsd-css1-introduction.github.io/overview/intro.html))

**CSS 2**: Data and Model Programming for Computational Social Science ([website](https://ucsd-css2.github.io/ucsd-css2-website/intro.html))

**CSS 100**: Advanced Programming for Computational Social Science 

**COGS 101C**: Language 

**COGS 153**: Language Comprehension

**COGS 150**: Large Language Models and Cognitive Science 

**COGS 14A**: Introduction to Research Methods  

**COGS 14B**: Introduction to Statistical Analysis   



## Methods tutorials

I also create resources for people interested in learning more about statistics and programming in R or Python: see [this page](https://seantrott.github.io/stats/) for more details.


## Additional information

In Spring 2019, [Pamela Rivi√®re](https://pdrivier.github.io/about/) and I organized a course and speaker series called: **Data Practices (in the 21st century)**. The course featured speakers from a number of departments, including: Anthropology, Computer Science and Engineering, and History.
