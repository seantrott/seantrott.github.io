### Mentoring

One of my favorite parts of being in science is mentoring students who want to learn more about research. 

So far, I've served on a couple Honors Thesis committees in the department:

- Alex Liebscher: [do metaphors we use describe experiences with cancer affect charitable donations](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/honors-program/Liebscher,-Alex_Thesis---Metaphors-on-Charitable-Donations.pdf)  
- Monica Van: [do memes scaffold learning mathematical concepts](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/honors-program/Monica-Van_HonorsThesis_-Memes-and-Math-Instruction.pdf)


### Additional information

In Spring 2019, [Pamela Rivi√®re](https://pdrivier.github.io/about/) and I organized a course and speaker series called: **Data Practices (in the 21st century)**. The course featured speakers from a number of departments, including: Anthropology, Computer Science and Engineering, and History. The syllabus can be found [here](https://cogs200sp2019.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/syllabus/).

For the past two academic years (2019-2020, 2020-present), I've also served as the *Statistics in R Methods TA* for the Cognitive Science department. I've written a number of [statistics tutorials, mostly in R](https://seantrott.github.io/stats/).
