I'm developing a set of statistics-related tutorials and blog posts. I've found it useful to write them, so hopefully they can also be of use to others--at least as introductions to a new topic.

Statistics (mostly in R):

* [Introduction to correlations and linear regression in R](https://seantrott.github.io/correlations/)   
* [Introduction to ANOVAs in R](https://seantrott.github.io/anova_R/)
* [Mixed models in R](https://seantrott.github.io/mixed_models_R/)   
* [Binary classification in R](https://seantrott.github.io/binary_classification_R/)  
* [Data wrangling and visualization in R](https://seantrott.github.io/data_wrangling_visualization/)  
* [Data visualization in Python](https://seantrott.github.io/data_visualization_python/)  
* [Model comparison in R](https://seantrott.github.io/model_comparison/)
* [Bias, variance, and the bed of Procrustes](https://seantrott.github.io/procrustean_models/)  
* [P-hacking: a demonstration in R](https://seantrott.github.io/p-hacking/)  
* [Regularization for feature selection](https://seantrott.github.io/regularization/)  

Natural Language Processing:

* [Text processing in Python (tutorial)](https://seantrott.github.io/nlp_basics/) [slides](https://seantrott.github.io/nlp_basics/slides#/)  
* [Intro to word embeddings (blog post)](https://seantrott.github.io/embeddings/)
