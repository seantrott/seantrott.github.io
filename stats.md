I'm developing a set of statistics-related tutorials and walkthroughs. I find it useful to write about new statistical techniques that I learn about, so hopefully those write-ups can also be of use to others, at least as introductions to a new topic.

Here's what I have so far:

* [Mixed models in R](https://seantrott.github.io/mixed_models_R/)   
* [P-hacking: a demonstration in R](https://seantrott.github.io/p-hacking/)  
* [Regularization for feature selection](https://seantrott.github.io/regularization/)
