I'm developing a set of statistics-related tutorials and blog posts. I've found it useful to write them, so hopefully they can also be of use to others--at least as introductions to a new topic.

Here's what I have so far:

* [Introduction to correlations and linear regression in R](https://seantrott.github.io/correlations/)   
* [Introduction to ANOVAs in R](https://seantrott.github.io/anova_R/)
* [Mixed models in R](https://seantrott.github.io/mixed_models_R/)   
* [Binary classification in R](https://seantrott.github.io/binary_classification_R/)
* [P-hacking: a demonstration in R](https://seantrott.github.io/p-hacking/)  
* [Regularization for feature selection](https://seantrott.github.io/regularization/)
