title: Data visualization in Python [stats]
---

I recently created a tutorial on [data visualization in Python](https://seantrott.github.io/data_visualization_python/), which gives a brief overview to `pyplot` and `seaborn. 

It's also available in slides format [here](https://seantrott.github.io/data_visualization_python/trott.slides.html#/).

Hope it is helpful!
