title: The extended mind [research review]
---


The notion that our minds extend beyond the boundaries of our bodies seems strange at first. But when we look more closely, we see that these boundaries are actually quite fuzzy.

One of the most famous cases for extended cognition comes from Clark & Chalmers (1998). Consider the cognitive problem of playing Tetris: to solve the problem, players must identify whether an incoming shape fits into any of the "sockets" at the bottom of the screen. Now consider a few ways a player might solve this problem:

1) A player could mentally rotate incoming blocks, simulating what it would look like in different configurations.
2) A player could press a button to actually rotate incoming blocks on the screen, presumably getting a higher-fidelity picture of their different configurations (and perhaps gaining a speed advantage). 
3) Sometime in the cyberpunk , a player is given a neural implant which can perform the mental rotation just as quickly as the button-press in (2). 

Clark & Chalmers (1998) then ask: how much cognition is present in each case, and where is it located?

Our initial intuition is that (1) and (3) are pretty analogous: in both cases, the rotation process happens "inside" the brain––either with or without the help of an implanted device. But if we accept that a neural implant counts as cognition, what differentiates these scenarios from (2)? Besides the skin/skull boundary, the computation seems roughly the same: an individual executes a rotation process with the goal of better identifying where an incoming Tetris block will best fit.

Clark & Chalmers (1998) suggest that there's no principled reason to insist that (1) and (3) are cognition, and (2) is not. Cases involving an external tool should still count as cognition––just a form of cognition that extends beyond the skin/skull boundary. In these cases:

> the human organism is linked with an external entity in a two-way interaction, creating a coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right. All the components in the system play an active causal role, and they jointly govern behaviour in the same sort of way that cognition usually does. If we remove the external component the system's behavioural competence will drop, just as it would if we removed part of its brain. Our thesis is that this sort of coupled process counts equally well as a cognitive process, whether or not it is wholly in the head (pg. 9).

Once we relax the skin/skull boundary, we find that there are all sorts of examples where our cognitive capacities seem to be *augmented* by the use of an external tool. For example, if someone with memory loss were to rely entirely on their computer to record everything that happened each day, and consulted that computer each time they made a decision, should that computer be considered part of their mind? Or perhaps more precisely: should the person and the computer together be considered a kind of coupled, cognitive system?
