title: Migrating to Substack
---

I'm migrating to [Substack](https://seantrott.substack.com/). 

There are a few reasons:

1. Better interface for writing/editing posts.  
2. Built-in network effects.  
3. The newsletter format makes it easier to reach interested readers consistently (and I don't feel like creating my own newsletter script).  

I'll probably still post statistics tutorials and such here, but more philosophical or policy-oriented posts will be on the Substack.
