title: The role of functional load in sound change
---

Languages are constantly changing. Just as [words drift in meaning over many generations](https://seantrott.github.io/semantic-drift/), the basic **sounds** of a language can shift over time.

These changes are often highly regular and systematic. For example, during the evolution of [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) (PIE) to [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language), there was a series of changes to stop consonants known as [Grimm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law). The phoneme */d/* (as in *dog*) shifted to */t/* (as in *talk*); */t/*, meanwhile, became */θ/* (as in *think*). 

These changes weren't attested in other evolved variants of PIE. This allows us to compare words with common ancestries across language families. The Latin *decem* has its counterpart in the English *ten* (Dutch: *tien*; Norwegian: *ti*), and the Latin *tres* (starting with */t/*) is a cousin to the English *three* (starting with */θ/*). (Note that many other changes have occurred, which is why you'll see more differences than simply a shift in */t/* and */d/*.)

Grimm's Law also involved many other changes, and is far from the only major phonological change to occur in the history of Germanic languages (see [The Great Vowel Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift)). However, Grimm's Law is an important example of sound change being a **regular** process--i.e., a given change should apply throughout the lexicon of a language, provided the appropriate conditions are met.

[Phonological change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_change) is an incredibly rich field of study. Research questions abound, including: the link between perceptual/articulatory constraints and large-scale sound change (Ohala, 1993; Ohala, 1989), the social variables involved (Labov, 1963; Labov, 1986), and more.

For me, one particularly interesting aspect of sound change is its relationship to the creation of **homophones**: two words that sound the same, but with different meanings (e.g., *night* and *knight*).

# Sound change and homophony

Sound changes are often classified into one of several categories: mergers, splits, and losses. 

A *merger* occurs when the distinction between two phonemes in a language is lost. An example in English is the famous [cot-caught merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cot%E2%80%93caught_merger). In some dialects of English, the vowel in the word *cot* is produced (and perceived) differently than the vowel in the *caught*. However, many dialects of North American English don't really distinguish between the two. I certainly pronounce them the same way. In other words, the lost of this contrast has produced a **homophone**.

Other examples of homophony-inducing sound changes in English abound. Modern English witnessed the [loss of many word-initial *consonant clusters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_consonant_clusters#Reduction_of_/kn/), such as */kn/* and */gn/*. In some cases, this created homophones among formerly distinct word pairs, e.g., *knight*/*night*, *not*/*knot*, and *nit*/*knit*. (Interestingly, these word-initial consonant clusters have been fossilized in the spelling of the words.)

Homophony-inducing sound changes aren't limited to English. Sampson (2013, 2015) describes a series of [sound changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Chinese_phonology) that occurred between Middle and Modern Chinese, such as the merging of final *-m* and final *-n* as simply *-n*. This created many homophones, particularly among monosyllabic words. Sampson (2013) 

[...]

Intuitively, both mergers and losses appear more likely to *increase*, rather than *decrease*, the number of homophones in a language, given that they eliminate phoneme contrasts that previously might have distinguished words.

Of course, some kinds of sound change, such as [splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_change#Split) could theoretically reduce the number of homophones by increasing the number of possible phonemic contrasts. As Ceolin (2020) points out, the presumed regularity of sound change makes this scenario unlikely. That is, if two words have the same form (e.g., *bank* and *bank*), it is unlikely that only one of those words will undergo a sound change. Still, it is in principle possible, especially if the two words vary considerably in frequency---in which case the more frequent word (e.g., *time*) tends to undergo a reduction process relative to the less frequent word (e.g., *thyme*) (Gahl, 2008).
