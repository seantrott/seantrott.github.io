title: Binary classification in R (tutorial)
---

Last week, I ran a workshop for the Cognitive Science department entitled "Binary classification in R". [Here's a link to the tutorial I developed for the workshop](https://seantrott.github.io/binary_classification_R/).

I expect to augment the tutorial with more information and pointers to resources in the future--so if you see anything missing that you'd like to learn about, or if you disagree with something I wrote, feel free to contact me (seantrott at ucsd dot edu).
