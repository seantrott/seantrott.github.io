title: Some books I read in 2020
---

In mid-2020, I wrote a [summary of three books I read this year](https://seantrott.github.io/reviews/). I'm going to expand on that post here---focusing on books that have made an impact insofar as I keep thinking about them after I read them. In some cases I'll group multiple books together that vary along a theme, or which I associate for some reason. As in that earlier post, the point is largely personal, i.e., helping me remember these books and what I got out of them, but hopefully they might inspire readers of this post to check them out as well.

**Piranesi**, by Susanna Clarke. 


List:

- Why we're polarized  
- why we love dogs, ... 
- Piranesi  
- The Overstory  
- Merchants of doubt
- The Outline Trilogy
- Milkman
- Circe/Song of Achilles
- Ball Lightning
- Blindness
