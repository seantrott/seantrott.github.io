title: Some books I read in 2020
---

In mid-2020, I wrote a [summary of three books I read this year](https://seantrott.github.io/reviews/). I'm going to expand on that post here---focusing on books that have made an impact insofar as I keep thinking about them after I read them. In some cases I'll group multiple books together that vary along a theme, or which I associate for some reason. As in that earlier post, the point is largely personal, i.e., helping me remember these books and what I got out of them, but hopefully they might inspire readers of this post to check them out as well.

**Piranesi**, by Susanna Clarke. This book is really haunting. The premise is quite unique: the narrator, who is called "Piranesi", describes his days wandering a crumbling and apparently endless house. He's not really concerned or scared about his situation. In fact, he demonstrates an incredible reverence and love for "The House". He occasionally interacts with another human (whom he calls "The Other"), who is keen to discover what he believes to be a secret power hidden inside the house. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the narrator's genuine and earnest love for the House; he sees himself as a kind of servant or vassal of a larger mission, and this sentiment is beautifully conveyed in the diary passages.

**The Outline Trilogy**, by Rachel Cusk. This is technically three books, the first of which is called [*Outline*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(novel)).
