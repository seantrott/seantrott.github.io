title: Notes on smell (Gilbert) [research notes]
---

I'm trying to learn more about **smell**. 

I've [written about olfaction a bit before](https://seantrott.github.io/smell/), with a focus on how people use language to describe olfactory experiences. To the extent that I conduct my own research on smell, I assume that it will focus on the intersection between smell and language. But I think it will also be important––and just interesting––to develop a firmer background in how the olfactory system works.

To that end, I recently read [*What the nose knows*](https://www.whatthenoseknows.com/), a book by [Avery Gilbert](https://www.averygilbert.com/). Yet the problem with just reading a book––even if one takes some notes––is that [the information inevitably slips away](https://andymatuschak.org/books/). So I think there's considerable value in writing a summary of some of the key points I'd like to remember, because:

- The act of writing the summary helps consolidate some of those memories.  
- The summary itself serves as a usual artifact, which I can consult later to *cue* those memories.

So here are some of the things I found most interesting from the book.

### It's hard to figure out the natural "categories" of smell-space

People have been interested in taxonomizing smell-space for quite some time. 

[Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus), that lover of categories, attempted an initial classification of smell. Others followed, like Hans Henning, who created the ["odor prism"](https://dictionary.apa.org/hennings-odor-prism)––representing the six "primary" dimensions of olfactory experience––which was appealing conceptually but (apparently) underwhelming from an empirical perspective. Later still, Ann Noble  created the ["Aroma Wheel"](https://www.winearomawheel.com/) for wine, which apparently is still used by wine experts.

Yet the challenge is that––with some exceptions, like compounds containing sulfur––the relationship between the structure of an odor molecule and the olfactory experiences it elicits is hard to predict. Again, this is not to say there's no systematicity whatsoever. But at least as presented in the book, it seems that––compared with domains like color or sound––the fundamental "dimensions" of olfactory experience are harder to categorize.

### People are actually pretty good at smell

There's a common belief that humans are bad at smelling things. And it's true that we have fewer olfactory receptor genes than mammals like rats. But humans display some surprisingly good olfactory abilities.

1. Parents can apparently pick out their infants' diaper in a line-up (and they also find it less unpleasant to smell).   
2. Humans can also train themselves to recognize the volatile compounds in certain drugs (a task usually relegated to [detection dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_dog), e.g., at the airport).  
3. Humans can also *improve* at smell; further, smell professionals (like sommeliers and perfume experts) display systematically different brain activity in an fMRI scanner than novices during a smell task––experts see more blood flow to the [orbitofrontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex), which is sometimes associated with decision-making.


### Humans have two olfactory pathways

There are two distinct ways of smelling: **orthonasal** (where odor molecules enter through the nose) and **retronasal** (where odor molecules are sent back up through the nasal pathway during the act of chewing and swallowing). 

This [latter pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retronasal_smell)] is apparently particularly developed in humans, and plays a big role in our experience of **flavor** (as contrasted with the simpler experience of **taste**).
