I've decided to try out GitHub's website service in favor of my existing WordPress account for two main reasons:  
1. It's free.  
2. It's easier to integrate R/Python code into my blog posts.  

So going forward, my blog posts will be posted on this site instead. Eventually, I'd like to migrate all my content from WordPress over here, though that might take some time.
