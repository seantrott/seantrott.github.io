# "What's that smell?"

Olfaction is a important sense: it's largely what allows us to identify rotten food, it's a huge part of our experience of [*flavor*](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=212), and it may be deeply connected to [emotions and memory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-babble/201501/smells-ring-bells-how-smell-triggers-memories-and-emotions).

Yet for the most part, people in Western, industrialized societies don't appear to be very good at naming odors. Majid & Burenhult (2014, pg. 266-267) write:

> Presented with familiar everyday objects, such as coffee, peanut butter or chocolate, ordinary people correctly name only around 50% of odors...If people displayed similar performance with a visual object, they would be diagnosed as aphasic and sent for medical help.

This might be because we simply don't have that many *words* for odors. In particular, languages spoken by individuals in Western societies tend to have few, if any, **abstract odor categories**. When we refer to a smell, we typically do so by naming either its *intensity* (*a pungent scent*), its *valence* (*a fragrant scent*), or the source itself (*cinnnamon*). The first two strategies reflect a kind of abstraction, but this abstraction is more evaluative than qualitative---that is, we're not necessarily referring to the *kind* of smell, but the *kind of experience* we associate with that smell. And the third strategy relies on referring to the specific source responsible for the odor percept. 

The limitations of our olfactory language are quite clear when contrasted with visual domains such as color. English speakers have recourse to a variety of "basic" color terms (Berlin & Kay, 1991), including: red, orange, blue, yellow, and more. While these terms may have originated from words for real-world entities, they now reflect relatively abstracted categories: lots of things can be *red*, from firetrucks to roses. Even a swatch of color on a page can be *red*. (Of course, some shades are more prototypical members of a color category than others, but this merely reflects the fact that the category system has carved up an underlying physical space, with some instances being more "central" in a category than others.)

As Berlin & Kay (1991) describe, languages vary in the *number* of color terms they have, but for the most part, languages possess at least several abstracted, basic color terms. Yet this doesn't appear to be the case for odor. Why not?

# Differential ineffability of the senses

Because of our difficulty in referring to odors, the sense of smell is sometimes thought to be **ineffable**, i.e., difficult to put into words (Levinson & Majid, 2014). One way ineffability is measured or characterized is via **codability**: how easy is it for speakers of a language to express some percept/concept (e.g., an odor or color), and to what extent does the expression they choose align with the expressions that other speakers choose?

People in Western, industrialized societies exhibit notoriously poor codability for odor (Majid & Burenult, 2014), but not for other senses like color. This has led some to assume that maybe humans are just *incapable* of developing and using abstract words for smell. Olfactory specialist Hans Henning writes:

> Olfactory abstraction is impossible. We can easily abstract the common shared color – i.e., white – of jasmine, lily-of-the-valley, camphor and milk, but no man can similarly abstract a common odor by attending to what they have in common and setting aside their differences. (Henning, 1916, p. 66)

If this is true---i.e., if humans really can't develop abstract linguisitc categories for odor---then it's likely due to constraints imposed by the underlying neural architecture for olfaction. The job of scientists would then be to figure exactly what those constraints are and where they come from.

But there's a problem with the chain of inferencing described above. Much of the evidence comes from research on native speakers or English or other Western languages. Yet we already know speakers of these languages tend to be from [WEIRD](https://slate.com/technology/2013/05/weird-psychology-social-science-researchers-rely-too-much-on-western-college-students.html) cultures: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. And WEIRD humans may not be representative of humans *in general*.

Majid & Burenhult (2014) put it better than I could (emphasis mine):

> There are around 6000–7000 languages spoken today, **each one a solution to the communicative situation faced by speakers in different socio-cultural and ecological niches**. This raises the question of whether the apparent ineffability, or inability to put words to smells, is really telling us something about all of humanity, or something specific about speakers of English.

And in fact, there is considerable evidence that other languages, particularly those spoken by small, hunter-gatherer communities, *do* contain abstract words for smell. The **Jahai people** are on such group.

# Olfactory codability across *languages*

The Jahai people are a group of nomadic hunter-gatherers, who live in the rainforests between Malaysia and Thailand. Critically, they appear to have "basic" smell words---over a dozen verbs of olfaction that are used to describe a wide array of odors. For example, the term *CNes* is used for the smell of "petrol, smoke, bat droppings and bat caves, some species of millipede, root of wild ginger, leaf of gingerwort, wood of wild mango", and more (Majid & Burenhult, 2014, pg. 267).

Clearly, the Jahai olfactory lexicon is more expressive than the English lexicon. But does that translate into increased codability? That is, how *easily* do Jahai speakers name odors, and to what extent is there *agreement* across Jahai speakers about the label for a given odor? This is exactly the question that Majid & Burenhult (2014) address.

## Design

The experimental design is relatively simple. 10 native speakers of Jahai were administered the **Brief Smell Identification Test** (B-SIT); 10 American English speakers, matched for age, were also given the test. In the test, participants are presented with a series of encapsulated odors, which are released by scratching a card with a pencil---similar to the "scratch and sniff" books you might've read as a child. 12 odorants were presented in total.

In addition to the odor test, participants were presented with a classic color naming test, to act as a within-language comparison.

## Results

Codability was calculated using a measure called [**Simpson's Diversity Index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index), or *D*. I won't describe it in detail here, but the short version is that it measures the rate of agreement for a given odor by comparing the number of responses (i.e., from all the participants) sharing the same label to the total number of responses overall. A value of 1 thus indicates perfect agreement, while a value of 0 indicates that every participant used a different label.

Basic outline:
People have long assumed that humans have trouble naming odors, and in particular comparing and grouping orders into higher-level categories (as we do with color). Group by valence and intensity, but not really according to other dimensions (e.g., "fragrant" and 'stinky' is more evaluative than referring to the quality), and typically use source-based language.
Is smell "ineffable"? Impossible to put into words?
Problem: this research comes from WEIRD languages. 6000-7000 languages in the world (at least).
Question: Compare codability of odor (and color) for Jahai and English speakers.
Results: Much more codability for Jahai for odor.

Discuss some of the example "categories" that exist:
- "p÷ih" --> to have a blood-like, fish-like, meat-like smell
-

Also lots of other work on other languages: Maniq (in Thailand)
