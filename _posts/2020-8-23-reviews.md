title: Books I've read recently
---

This post will be different from most of my other posts here. 

I've recently been trying to read more "classics"--where a "classic" is loosely defined as a piece of writing that's frequently referenced in a given discipline or domain and appears to have influenced that domain (or even other spheres of activity). Unfortunately, I also frequently *forget* much of what a book is about soon after I've read it, even books that I took notes on while reading. This is truer, I think, of nonfiction than fiction.

To try to address this problem of forgetting, I thought a potentially interesting way to spend my Sunday afternoon would be to write brief summaries of several of these books. A summary is not really a review, and it's certainly not an in-depth analysis of a book. Thus, these summaries may not ultimately resolve the forgetting issue; on the other hand, I'm hoping that simply reviewing my notes to compile the summaries will help consolidate and organize my memories of each book.


# The Odyssey (translated by Emily Wilson)

Somewhat shamefully, I'd never in fact read the entire Odyssey before. I read portions of it in high school, and of course I was familiar with many of the stories and characters it contains, but I'd never read it start to finish.

Recently, I listened to an interview with [Madeline Miller on Ezra Klein's podcast](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/4/24/21233353/madeline-miller-the-ezra-klein-show-circe-the-song-of-achilles-greek-myth); Miller wrote *Song of Achilles* and *Circe*, two beautiful retellings of classic myths, both of which focus on characters who got short shrift in the versions most of us know (Patroclus and Circe, respectively). In the interview, Miller mentioned that she loved Emily Wilson's translation of [*The Odyssey*](https://www.emilyrcwilson.com/the-odyssey). Wilson is the first woman to publish an English translation of the myth.

One thing I was struck by was how well the writing "flowed"; I was expecting a bit of a slog, but it went quite quickly. There were many beautiful and moving passages, and I can genuinely say I felt captivated throughout.

Another thing that surprised me was simply how little of the text is devoted to what I always assumed were the central moments of Odysseus's journey (i.e., battling the Cyclops, meeting Circe, the men opening the bag of wind from Aeolus, and so on). In fact, these moments are all recounted *by Odysseus* to the Phaeacians. This comes after Odysseus has settled himself in their halls and is experiencing intense emotion as a bard tells the story of the Trojan War (spurred on to do so, I should say, by Odysseus himself); it also occurs after Odysseus impresses the Phaeacians with his discus-throwing abilities (a scene I found very comical). This recounting is not without details, but just in terms of the number of pages it takes up, it almost feels "minor" with respect to the overarching plot. 

It's also interesting to interpret this recounting from the lens of Odysseus's propensity towards cunning and deceit more generally--something that's emphasized through the novel. Unlike the rest of the epic, this section is told from Odysseus's perspective, not from the perspective of an omniscient narrator. How are we, the hearers/readers, meant to think about the veracity of these accounts? Should we take them at face value or could it be yet another case of Odysseus's manipulation--this time cleverly embedded within the text itself?
