title: Books I've read recently
---

This post will be different from most of my other posts here. 

I've recently been trying to read more "classics"--where a "classic" is loosely defined as a piece of writing that's frequently referenced in a given discipline or domain and appears to have influenced that domain (or even other spheres of activity). Unfortunately, I also frequently *forget* much of what a book is about soon after I've read it, even books that I took notes on while reading. This is truer, I think, of nonfiction than fiction.

To try to address this problem of forgetting, I thought a potentially interesting way to spend my Sunday afternoon would be to write brief summaries of several of these books. A summary is not really a review, and it's certainly not an in-depth analysis of a book. Thus, these summaries may not ultimately resolve the forgetting issue; on the other hand, I'm hoping that simply reviewing my notes to compile the summaries will help consolidate and organize my memories of each book.

Recently, I listened to an interview with [Madeline Miller on Ezra Klein's podcast](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/4/24/21233353/madeline-miller-the-ezra-klein-show-circe-the-song-of-achilles-greek-myth); Miller wrote *Song of Achilles* and *Circe*, two beautiful retellings of classic myths, both of which focus on characters who got short shrift in the versions most of us know (Patroclus and Circe, respectively). In the interview, Miller mentioned that she loved Emily Wilson's translation of [*The Odyssey*](https://www.emilyrcwilson.com/the-odyssey). Wilson is the first woman to publish an English translation of the myth,
