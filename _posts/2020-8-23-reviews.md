title: Books I've read recently
---

This post will be different from most of my other posts here. 

I've recently been trying to read more "classics"--where a "classic" is loosely defined as a piece of writing that's frequently referenced in a given discipline or domain and appears to have influenced that domain (or even other spheres of activity). Unfortunately, I also frequently *forget* much of what a book is about soon after I've read it, even books that I took notes on while reading. This is truer, I think, of nonfiction than fiction.

To try to address this problem of forgetting, I thought a potentially interesting way to spend my Sunday afternoon would be to write brief summaries of several of these books. A summary is not really a review, and it's certainly not an in-depth analysis of a book. Thus, these summaries may not ultimately resolve the forgetting issue; on the other hand, I'm hoping that simply reviewing my notes to compile the summaries will help consolidate and organize my memories of each book.
