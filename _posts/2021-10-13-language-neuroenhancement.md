title: Language is a neuroenhancement [research review]
---

In Cognitive Science and Psycholinguistics, research on language tends to emphasize its role as a communicative medium. This emphasis lends itself to questions about how language is produced and understood, i.e., for the purposes of communication. That is, how does a speaker wishing to convey an idea *formulate* a linguistic expression from that idea, and how does a comprehender *decipher* the original idea from the linguistic expression they observe? And of course, there are a variety of theories about how all this happens––ranging from "amodal" theories that emphasize the role of disembodied, symbolic concepts, to more "embodied" theories that emphasize the role of sensorimotor experience in linguistic knowledge ([Bergen, 2012](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/benjamin-k-bergen/louder-than-words/9780465033331/); [Barsalou, 1999](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/perceptual-symbol-systems/C2D720D63C1CE3D7153F6BA473F9DD87); [Gallese & Lakoff, 2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643290442000310?casa_token=p8Gkab5SjWcAAAAA%3AoL77ooE6D1aODk4UWJt8j70E52xL8VWnhn6us9EjmVm5RRLRcjGW97zE_dMD0QjOIGuISgIC4wU)). 

But as Dove (2020) notes, this traditional emphasis neglects another, equally interesting question: what is the role of language in *thought*?

This question becomes especially interesting if we adopt an embodied perspective. Language is, after all, a form of embodied experience. To produce language, we engage various *effectors* (e.g., we move our tongues and lips, or our hands and fingers). And so, if we believe––as proponents of embodied cognition do––that our conceptual representations make use of sensorimotor experience, then why shouldn't that include the sensorimotor experiences associated with language in particular? 

Put another way: how does having language––any language at all––shape our capacity for thought ([^1])?


# Tools for thought


(Summarize work on extended cognition, etc.)



But what is the role of language itself in our conceptual representations? If we take the idea of “language as tool” seriously, then as Clark argues, we are all “linguistic cyborgs”. 

Then summarize the recent Dove (2020) article on language as a neuro-enhancement.

Emphasize the three points:

1) Label magic (also discusses Lupyan/Winter point about arbitrariness / limits of iconicity)
2) Associations as a new source of information––e.g., between words. We can now connect concepts that may not be obviously related at all in terms of the sensorimotor features of their referents.


(In a later post, connect to idea of cycles of intelligence: culture/language are an efficient way to bypass adaptation on either the evolutionary or "learning" timescales.)

[^1]: Note that I'm going to set aside, for now, the question of [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis––i.e., the extent to which our cognition is shaped by a *particular* language. Linguistic relativity is clearly related to Dove's (2020) point, and in fact follows logically from the premise that having *a* language shapes thought, but it's also a more specific question. Here, the emphasis is on how acquiring *any* language system can change our cognitive capacities.
