title: Language is a neuroenhancement [research review]
---

In Cognitive Science and Psycholinguistics, research on language tends to emphasize its role as a communicative medium. This emphasis lends itself to questions about how language is produced and understood, i.e., for the purposes of communication. That is, how does a speaker wishing to convey an idea *formulate* a linguistic expression from that idea, and how does a comprehender *decipher* the original idea from the linguistic expression they observe? In turn, there are a variety of theories about how all this happens––ranging from "amodal" theories that emphasize the role of disembodied, symbolic concepts, to more "embodied" theories that emphasize the role of sensorimotor experience in linguistic knowledge ([Bergen, 2012](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/benjamin-k-bergen/louder-than-words/9780465033331/); [Barsalou, 1999](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/perceptual-symbol-systems/C2D720D63C1CE3D7153F6BA473F9DD87); [Gallese & Lakoff, 2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643290442000310?casa_token=p8Gkab5SjWcAAAAA%3AoL77ooE6D1aODk4UWJt8j70E52xL8VWnhn6us9EjmVm5RRLRcjGW97zE_dMD0QjOIGuISgIC4wU)). 

But as Dove (2020) notes, this traditional emphasis sidelines another, equally interesting question: what is the role of language in *thought*?

This question becomes especially interesting if we adopt an embodied perspective. Language is, after all, a form of embodied experience. For example, to produce language, we have to move our tongues and lips, or our hands and fingers. And so, if we believe––as proponents of embodied cognition do––that our conceptual representations make use of sensorimotor experience, then why shouldn't that include the sensorimotor experiences associated with language in particular? 

Proponents of [extended cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis) sometimes go even further. According to this view, the mind does not merely reside in the brain, or even the body––"cognition" is a complex phenomenon emerging from brains, bodies, and the environments in which they're situated. Our cognitive capacities are scaffolded and even augmented by **external tools**. Thus, if language is a tool, then how might acquiring a language––any language––shape our capacity for thought ([^1])?

# Tools for thought

The notion that our minds extend beyond the boundaries of our bodies seems strange at first. But when we look more closely, we see that these boundaries are actually quite fuzzy.

## Block worlds

One of the most famous cases for extended cognition comes from Clark & Chalmers (1998). Consider the cognitive problem of playing Tetris: to solve the problem, players must identify whether an incoming shape fits into any of the "sockets" at the bottom of the screen. Now consider a few ways a player might solve this problem:

1) A player could mentally rotate incoming blocks, simulating what it would look like in different configurations.
2) A player could press a button to actually rotate incoming blocks on the screen, presumably getting a higher-fidelity picture of their different configurations (and perhaps gaining a speed advantage). 
3) Sometime in the future, a player is given a neural implant which can perform the mental rotation just as quickly as the button-press in (2). 

Clark & Chalmers (1998) then ask: how much cognition is present in each case, and where is it located?

Our initial intuition is that (1) and (3) are pretty analogous: in both cases, the rotation process happens "inside" the brain––either with or without the help of an implanted device. But if we accept that a neural implant counts as cognition, what differentiates these scenarios from (2)? Besides the skin/skull boundary, the computation seems roughly the same: an individual executes a rotation process with the goal of better identifying where an incoming Tetris block will best fit.

Clark & Chalmers (1998) suggest that there's no principled reason to insist that (1) and (3) are cognition, and (2) is not. Cases involving an external tool should still count as cognition––just one that extends beyond the skin/skull boundary. In these cases:

> the human organism is linked with an external entity in a two-way interaction, creating a coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right. All the components in the system play an active causal role, and they jointly govern behaviour in the same sort of way that cognition usually does. If we remove the external component the system's behavioural competence will drop, just as it would if we removed part of its brain. Our thesis is that this sort of coupled process counts equally well as a cognitive process, whether or not it is wholly in the head (pg. 9).

## Tools in the mind 


(Also summarise the work on multimodal neurons and the monkey result)



But what is the role of language itself in our conceptual representations? If we take the idea of “language as tool” seriously, then as Clark argues, we are all “linguistic cyborgs”. 

Then summarize the recent Dove (2020) article on language as a neuro-enhancement.

Emphasize the three points:

1) Label magic (also discusses Lupyan/Winter point about arbitrariness / limits of iconicity)
2) Associations as a new source of information––e.g., between words. We can now connect concepts that may not be obviously related at all in terms of the sensorimotor features of their referents.


(In a later post, connect to idea of cycles of intelligence: culture/language are an efficient way to bypass adaptation on either the evolutionary or "learning" timescales.)

# Footnotes

[^1]: Note that I'm going to set aside, for now, the question of [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis––i.e., the extent to which our cognition is shaped by a *particular* language. Linguistic relativity is clearly related to Dove's (2020) point, and in fact follows logically from the premise that having *a* language shapes thought, but it's also a more specific question. Here, the emphasis is on how acquiring *any* language system can change our cognitive capacities.
