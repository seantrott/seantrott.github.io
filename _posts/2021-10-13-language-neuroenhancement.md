title: Language is a neuroenhancement [research review]
---

In Cognitive Science and Psycholinguistics, research on language tends to emphasize its role as a communicative medium. This emphasis lends itself to questions about how language is produced and understood, i.e., for the purposes of communication. That is, how does a speaker wishing to convey an idea *formulate* a linguistic expression from that idea, and how does a comprehender *decipher* the original idea from the linguistic expression they observe? In turn, there are a variety of theories about how all this happens––ranging from "amodal" theories that emphasize the role of disembodied, symbolic concepts, to more "embodied" theories that emphasize the role of sensorimotor experience in linguistic knowledge ([Bergen, 2012](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/benjamin-k-bergen/louder-than-words/9780465033331/); [Barsalou, 1999](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/perceptual-symbol-systems/C2D720D63C1CE3D7153F6BA473F9DD87); [Gallese & Lakoff, 2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643290442000310?casa_token=p8Gkab5SjWcAAAAA%3AoL77ooE6D1aODk4UWJt8j70E52xL8VWnhn6us9EjmVm5RRLRcjGW97zE_dMD0QjOIGuISgIC4wU)). 

But as Dove (2020) notes, this traditional emphasis sidelines another, equally interesting question: what is the role of language in *thought*?

This question becomes especially interesting if we adopt an embodied perspective. Language is, after all, a form of embodied experience. For example, to produce language, we have to move our tongues and lips, or our hands and fingers. And so, if we believe––as proponents of embodied cognition do––that our conceptual representations make use of sensorimotor experience, then why shouldn't that include the sensorimotor experiences associated with language in particular? What does our embodied experience of producing and comprehending language do for us, cognitively speaking?

Proponents of [extended cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis) sometimes go even further. According to this view, the mind does not merely reside in the brain, or even the body––"cognition" is a complex phenomenon emerging from brains, bodies, and the environments in which they're situated (Clark & Chalmers, 1998). Our cognitive capacities are scaffolded and even augmented by **external tools**. And of course, language is a kind of tool. So this raises the question: how might acquiring a language––any language––shape our capacity for thought ([^1])?

# Thinking with words

To acquire language, we have to become proficient in all sorts of things. We have to produce and recognize the sounds of a language, the morphological structure of that language, and even the art of having a conversation. 

Dove (2020) suggests a few ways in which this acquired competence acts as a **neuroenhancement**. 

## Words as glue

One of the most basic functions of words is to **refer**. 

Nouns, for example, typically refer to some sort of entity ([^2]), often by means of carving out a category (e.g., "dog"). Dove (2020) suggests that the mere act of assigning *labels* to referents changes our conception of them, and enhances our ability to construct novel thoughts with and about them.

To illustrate this, first imagine the set of sensorimotor experiences one might associate with dogs. Presumably most dogs share a set of common features. If you've ever pet a dog, you know the experience of running your hand through its fur; if you've encountered a dog barking, you likely have some kind of stored auditory memory of that sound. And of course, if you've seen a dog, you have a rough visual schematic of what dogs look like––they're furry, they have four legs, they wag their tails.

Even without the word "dog", we might be able to connect these disparate sensory associations into a relatively unified, multimodal representation. But Dove (2020) argues that having the label **binds** these associations more effectively. Words are sticky, like glue––and now, each time you encounter the word "dog", you're accessing a set of different sensorimotor experiences that are bundled together by all sharing hte same label.

Dove isn't the only person to argue this. Elsewhere, Pulvermüller (2013) has argued that linguistic labels serve to **stabilize** and **organize** our conceptual representations, providing structure in an otherwise structure-less landscape of sensory experience.

Moreover, there's evidence to support this claim, much of which Dove reviews. For me, one of the main takeaways comes from a study by Lupyan et al (2007):

> Labeled categories are easier to learn than unlabeled categories even when the relevant experience is held constant and the labels are redundant (Dove, 2020, pg. 296).

## Language as a new source of information

Words don't (usually) just appear in isolation. Typically, they appear with other words. And importantly, there are regularities in which words co-occur with which other words: presumably, you're much more likely to observe the word "scalpel" near the word "surgeon" than near the word "teacher" ([^3]). 

Dove––and others before him (e.g., Firth, 1957; Harris, 1954; [Sahlgren, 2008](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1041938/FULLTEXT01.pdf); [Lupyan & Winter, 2018](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2017.0137))––suggests that these statistical regularities are actually a rich source of information: both about the meaning of words themselves ("you shall know a word by the company it keeps"), and about the world. In other words, language is a kind of rich knowledge base, implicitly and explicitly encoding many real-world relationships in the statistical relationships between words.

He also suggests that this statistical information might be particularly useful for our understanding of abstract concepts. One proposal ([Andrews et al, 2009](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-10379-001)) is that our conceptual representations are subserved by a kind of **hybrid** system: concrete concepts (e.g., "dog", "bed", etc.) rely more on non-linguistic, sensorimotor associations, while abstract concepts draw more on linguistic associations––both in terms of linguistic sensorimotor associations (e.g., movements of the tongue or mouth), and in terms of the statistical regularities among word co-occurrences.

Language, then, offers up all kinds of novel associations:

- Between words and their real-world referents.  
- Between grounded concepts.  
- Between words and other words. 

Dove (2020) argues that this allows us to make novel connections that would otherwise be impossible in the absence of language.

## A symbolic medium

Finally, language is a symbolic system (i.e., words are symbols for their meanings), which allows the recombination of those symbols (i.e., sequences of words can be rearranged in different orders to produce novel meanings). 


Ultimately, Dove (2020) suggests that **arbitrariness** is a key component of language's neuroenhancing effect. Word forms are (for the most part) arbitrarily related to the meanings they convey. 

(Arbitrariness --> makes it easier to reproduce similar thoughts in different situations.)




(In a later post, connect to idea of cycles of intelligence: culture/language are an efficient way to bypass adaptation on either the evolutionary or "learning" timescales.)

# Footnotes

[^1]: Note that I'm going to set aside, for now, the question of [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity), also known as the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis––i.e., the extent to which our cognition is shaped by a *particular* language. Linguistic relativity is clearly related to Dove's (2020) point, and in fact follows logically from the premise that having *a* language shapes thought, but it's also a more specific question. Here, the emphasis is on how acquiring *any* language system can change our cognitive capacities.

[^2]: Abstract concepts, of course, don't really have a real-world referent––or at the very least, it's much more difficult to pin their real-world referents down. But more on that later.

[^3]: Though I'm sure the determined reader could imagine a number of scenarios in which "scalpel" is more likely to co-occur with "teacher". If there's anything I've learned from studying language, it's that people can construe almost *anything* to make sense.
