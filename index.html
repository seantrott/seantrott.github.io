I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at University of California, San Diego. See my <a href="https://seantrott.github.io/teaching/">my teaching page</a> for more information about courses I've taught or will teach, and my <a href="https://seantrott.github.io/research/">my research page</a> for an overview of my research interests. 

Before this, I was a PhD student (also at UCSD), where I worked with Dr. Benjamin Bergen. 

<p>I also like <a href="https://seantrott.bandcamp.com/album/oscillations">writing music</a>, cooking, climbing, and hanging out with my <a href="https://pdrivier.github.io/about/">partner</a> and our two cats.
