I am a Cognitive Science graduate student at University of California, San Diego, where I work with Dr. Benjamin Bergen. 

<h2 id="overview">Research overview</h2>

<p>Broadly, I'm interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how human comprehenders construct meaning from under-specified linguistic input;</li>
  <li>what human production and comprehension systems can tell us about language evolution;</li>
  <li>how to leverage insights from psycholinguistics to improve natural language understanding.</li>
</ul> 

<p>For more details on my research, see <a href="https://seantrott.github.io/research/">my research page]().</a>

<h2 id="info">More information</h2>

<p>I also like to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/seantrott">write music</a>, <a href="https://seanmakesfood.wordpress.com/">make food</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9359693">read books</a>, and do things outdoors (climb, tennis, soccer). </p> 

<p>I will eventually migrate all the posts on my old blog over here, but for now, you can find the other posts at <a href="https://seantrott.com/blog/">seantrott.com/blog</a>.</p>
