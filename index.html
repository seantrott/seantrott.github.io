I am a Cognitive Science graduate student at University of California, San Diego, where I work with Dr. Benjamin Bergen. 

<h2 id="overview">Research overview</h2>

<p>Broadly, I'm interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how human comprehenders construct meaning from under-specified linguistic input;</li>
  <li>what human production and comprehension systems can tell us about language evolution;</li>
  <li>how to leverage insights from psycholinguistics to improve natural language understanding.</li>
</ul> 

<p>For more details on my research, see [my research page](https://seantrott.github.io/research/).</p>

<h2 id="info">More information</h2>

I also like to [write music](https://soundcloud.com/seantrott), [make food](https://seanmakesfood.wordpress.com/), [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9359693), and do things outdoors (climb, tennis, soccer).

I will eventually migrate all the posts on my old blog over here, but for now, you can find the other posts at [seantrott.com/blog](https://seantrott.com/blog/).
