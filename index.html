I am an Assistant Professor at Rutgers University-Newark, where I lead the [Language, Cognition, and Computation lab](https://seantrott.github.io/lcc-lab/).

See <a href="https://seantrott.github.io/teaching/">my teaching page</a> for more information about courses I've taught or will teach, and <a href="https://seantrott.github.io/research/">my research page</a> for an overview of my research interests. 

<p>I like <a href="https://seantrott.bandcamp.com/album/oscillations">writing music</a>, cooking, climbing, and hanging out with my <a href="https://pdrivier.github.io/about/">wife</a> and daughter and our two cats.

<p>I also started a <a href="https://seantrott.substack.com/">newsletter</a>, which features posts on topics like Cognitive Science, AI, and statistics.
