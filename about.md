I am a Cognitive Science graduate student at University of California, San Diego, where I work with Dr. Benjamin Bergen. 

I'm interested in:

* how humans understand and produce language;
* what human production and comprehension systems can tell us about language evolution; and 
* how to leverage insights from psycholinguistics to improve natural language understanding.
