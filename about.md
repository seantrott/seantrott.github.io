I am a Cognitive Science graduate student at University of California, San Diego, where I work with [Dr. Benjamin Bergen](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/). 

I'm interested in:

* how human comprehenders contend with ambiguous or under-specified linguistic input;
* why human languages contain so much ambiguity; and 
* how to leverage insights from psycholinguistics to improve natural language understanding.

For more details on my research, see [my research page](https://seantrott.github.io/research/) and [my cv](https://seantrott.github.io/cv/). For information about courses I've taught, see my [teaching page](https://seantrott.github.io/teaching/).
