I am a Cognitive Science graduate student at University of California, San Diego, where I work with Dr. Benjamin Bergen. 

I'm interested in:

* how humans understand under-specified and ambiguous linguistic input;
* what human production and comprehension systems can tell us about language evolution; and 
* how to leverage insights from psycholinguistics to improve natural language understanding.

For more details on my research, see [my research page](https://seantrott.github.io/research/) and [my cv](https://seantrott.github.io/cv/).
