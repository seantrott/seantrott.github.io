I am a Cognitive Science PhD student at University of California, San Diego, where I work with Dr. Benjamin Bergen. I'm interested in how humans understand and produce language, what constraints on these processes can tell us about language evolution, and how to leverage insights from psycholinguistics to improve natural language understanding.

I also like to make food, write music, read books, and do things outdoors (climb, tennis, soccer).
