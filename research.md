## Why are languages so ambiguous?

Human lexica are rife with ambiguity––words with the same *form*, but different *meanings*. Sometimes these meanings are entirely unrelated, as is the case for **homophony** (e.g., the *bark* of a dog vs. the *bark* of a tree); sometimes they are closely related, as in **polysemy** (e.g., the *chicken* in the yard vs. the *chicken* on the plate).

Why would a communication system ostensibly evolved for efficient communication allow the reuse of the same signal for multiple meanings? Do homophones offer a benefit to languages and language users, or are they simply a (mostly harmless) "bug" in the system? And is polysemy subject to distinct selection pressures?

## Ambiguity in the mental lexicon

The prevalence of lexical ambiguity also raises the question of how human minds *process* and *represent* the meanings of ambiguous words.

Traditionally, words and their meanings as conceived as discrete entries in a mental dictionary. But meaning is often dynamically modulated in different contexts. We've been exploring an alternative account, in which word meanings are viewed as attractors in a continuous state-space---and then asking whether there is evidence for category boundaries atop this continuous space.

## Pragmatic inference

People often speak indirectly. For example, the sentence "My car isn't starting" could be intended not only as a statement of fact, but also as a request for a ride. Similarly, the sentence "Can you open that window?" can function as a request to open the window, a question about the hearer's ability to do so, or both. 

How do comprehenders determine whether a speaker is making a request? Specifically: which **linguistic and non-linguistic cues to an utterance's meaning** do comprehenders exploit to enrich the meaning of an under-specified utterance like "My car isn't starting"?
