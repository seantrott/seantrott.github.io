# Pragmatic inference

People often speak indirectly. For example, the sentence "My car isn't starting" could be intended not only as a statement of fact, but also as a request for a ride. Similarly, the sentence "Can you open that window?" can function as a request to open the window, a question about the hearer's ability to do so, or both. 

How do comprehenders determine whether a speaker is making a request? Specifically: which linguistic and non-linguistic cues to an utterance's meaning do comprehenders exploit to enrich the meaning of an under-specified utterance like "My car isn't starting"? 



# Ambiguity in the lexicon

I'm interested in the question of how human comprehenders construct meaning from ambiguous or under-specified input.
