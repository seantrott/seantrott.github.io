# <a id="pragmatic inference"></a>Pragmatic inference

People often speak indirectly. For example, the sentence "My car isn't starting" could be intended not only as a statement of fact, but also as a request for a ride. Similarly, the sentence "Can you open that window?" can function as a request to open the window, a question about the hearer's ability to do so, or both. 

How do comprehenders determine whether a speaker is making a request? Specifically: which **linguistic and non-linguistic cues to an utterance's meaning** do comprehenders exploit to enrich the meaning of an under-specified utterance like "My car isn't starting"? And what accounts for **individual differences** in the likelihood to *sample* and *deploy* particular cue to meaning?

## <a id="mentalizing"></a>Mentalizing for indirect request comprehension

Interlocutors don't always know or believe the same things. For example, a comprehender might know that the heater is broken, but the speaker might not. To what extent do comprehenders modulate their interpretation of an utterance like "It's cold in here" as a function of what the *speaker* believes about the world? And does a given comprehender's **mentalizing capacity** predict their likelihood of adopting a speaker's perspective when inferring what they mean?

## <a id="prosody"></a>The role of prosody in indirect request comprehension

Another cue to meaning is **prosody**: the rhythmic and intonational properties of how an utterance is spoken and signed. Can speakers and hearers use prosody to overcome the ambiguity of indirect requests?
